# generator-playsonapi [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> An opinionated framework for writing play web-services with jsonapi.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-playsonapi using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-playsonapi
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo playsonapi
```

Note that generator-playsonapi will prompt you for information about version numbers
for various sbt packages. This is for _setting_ those versions only. Actual package
installation and setup will be done by sbt by issuing `sbt clean compile` from your
project directory after yeoman has created your shiny new application.

## Getting To Know Yeoman

 * Yeoman has a heart of gold.
 * Yeoman is a person with feelings and opinions, but is very easy to work with.
 * Yeoman can be too opinionated at times but is easily convinced not to be.
 * Feel free to [learn more about Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).
